<h2>About this Project:</h2>

      For this project we were tasked with finding a local non profit and assessing their website to see what possible changes we could make to help the non profit if their site was found to have issues. We chose the Alamo Area Coalition Against Trafficking because we are all parents and feel strongly about protecting local youth and our project name is Traffic Jam.
    <br>
    <br>
    Our team was made up of Cathy Barron, Jack Pina, and myself, Josie Cothren.

      When we looked at the site as a group originally, we realized the problem was the site was not user friendly. It was very difficult to navigate the site and find information and it wasn’t even really clear what the purpose of the coalition was or how to become a part of it.

      <p> <h2>The Problem:</h2>
        The clarity of the purpose of the coalition and how it wants to accomplish it’s goals of fighting human trafficking and helping victims is not clearly found on the home page or the site.  We believe people who visit the site may have difficulty finding information easily and quickly.  The organization of the information on the website is hard to understand.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
   <p><h2>The Solution:</h2>
    We plan on helping improve navigation and organization of the site so that things are easier to find.  We would like to give clear visuals and concise text of what their mission is.  We would like to make information easily accessible to those that are in need.

      <p>As a group we tried to think of who the potential user of the site might be and so we came up with our Proto Persona of Christina Gibson. She is a person who volunteers in her community and wants to help children. She is also frustrated with the lack of information and community awareness in regards to human trafficking. With this potential user in mind, we went more in depth with our research.</p>

UI elements took away from the site such as a static logo and call for help boxes that made it difficult to read the page not to mention a misspelling in the logo itself. There was poor organization, links that didn’t work, dated material, a frustrating lack of an actual contact number or email, and a login creation with no idea of what you were signing up for and no confirmation that you had even joined something when you filled out the form.</p>

      With all of this new research information we were then able to create a much clearer picture of who our site user would be and the problems they might face while using the current site. We made an Empathy Map with our User Persona. Holly is a 35 year old child psychologist who volunteers as a youth soccer coach. She is feels strongly about bringing awareness to the community about the dangers and signs of human trafficking and wants to do her part to raise awareness and donate her services in the form of counseling to victims but she isn’t sure how to use the AACAT website and is frustrated by the difficulty in finding information and signing up.

     <p>During our review of the AACAT website, we discovered that the AACAT website is not user friendly. </p>
     <br>
     <p>Therefore, we believe that a redesign of the website might benefit potential users and other organizations.  We might be able to help AACAT if we help better organize the AACAT website so that users can find the information they need easily.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We might do this by organizing the website and improving site navigation making finding information easier for potential users.  We would like to make the purpose of the coalition and membership clearer using more precise language and make resources readily available for users. Doing this will allow our AACAT site to better serve potential users and help better connect multiple resources and organizations.
      The Alamo Area Coalition Against Trafficking is a group of organizations that are networked together to provide a number of different types of services for trafficking victims and those who advocate for them.

      <p>The Alamo Area Coalition Against Trafficking was established  to bring connectivinty and an open network of information and resources to the various members of the coalition and the victims they serve in their battle against human trafficking. We have observed that due to the coalition's current website design, navigation and the gathering of information is difficult for trafficking victims and their advocates causing them undue strain because they are unable to successfully get the help and information they require. </p>

   <p>How might we improve the AACAT’s website to assist potential users find the information they need and encourage more engagement and satisfaction with the site?</p>

      I created a storyboard to show our User Persona Holly’s journey through becoming aware of how close to home human trafficking is in her own community. She has been frustrated with the AACAT site in the past, but decides to use it again when she hears of it’s redesign.  Holly ultimately uses the newly designed site to join the coalition and get all the information she needs to raise awareness and help victims with her counseling services. She utilizes both the desktop and mobile versions of the AACAT site to create a profile and navigate the site easily to get the information she needs.

      It was clear from our user testing, heuristic analysis, and feature prioritization that simple clear navigation was going to be key in making the newly designed site more user friendly. With this important information in mind, we then created a sitemap for the redesigned site that would have a much clearer organization and navigation. Our new categories and header and footer would make information and services more readily available and accessible to our users.

      As a team we collaborated on what we really wanted the new site to look like. We created our wireframes for both the desktop and mobile versions of our home page with an emphasis on a crisp clean design with a clear message and easy to understand navigation. We concentrated mainly on how the navigation bar would work and what the message of the home page would be. We also wanted to make it very clear to users how to contact the coalition and how to join.

      <p>Once we had an idea of what the bones of our site would look like it was time to focus on the look and feel we wanted to convey. We created a moodboard of sorts by collecting images we thought really expressed the look and emotion we wanted our redesigned site to have. We wanted our imagery to be powerful and impactful and we wanted our topography to look clean and concise. Our color palette was pulled from the two blues found with the coalition’s logo,and a touch of red from our hero image. We also wanted a more effective use of white space. After five second user tests on our wireframe, we used this style guide to make our site look cohesive. We also expanded our site to better address the flow that our persona would be following when navigating the site.

    <p>Now it was time to gather more data through testing. We wanted to really express to users as soon as they arrived on the homepage the gravity of the issue the coalition was founded to combate. We knew to do that we needed a powerful hero image and we narrowed our choice to two. We conducted a series of A/B tests and our testers were extremely struck by both images just as our group was. Testers said you could see the cry for help in the little girl’s eyes and the symbolism in the red X. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p> Because of this we chose to use both images in our prototype and add a rotating animation between the two of them.

        <p>After our midlevel fidelity tests the event calendar page was expanded. There were no dates on the original site for users to look at and they could only be found on the coalition’s facebook. The one event mentioned on the site was painfully out of date. We added dates to the new site in the mid fidelity prototype which our testers commented that they much preferred, but they also prompted our users to then want an option to look at past and future calendar events. Because of this, we added representation of a navigable calendar in our high fidelity prototype. We also added information on the orientations and fundraising here. </p>
